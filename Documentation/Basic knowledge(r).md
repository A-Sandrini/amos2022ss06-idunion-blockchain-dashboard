<p>What is a distributed ledger?<br>
A distributed ledger is a database that is consensually shared and synchronized across multiple sites, institutions, or geographies, accessible by multiple people.<br>
It allows transactions to have public "witnesses": Every record in the distributed ledger has a timestamp and unique cryptographic signature, thus making the ledger an auditable, immutable history of all transactions in the network.<br>
The participant at each node of the network can access the recordings shared across that network and can own an identical copy of it.<br>
Any changes or additions made to the ledger are reflected and copied to all participants in a matter of seconds or minutes. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger.</p>
<p> What is a node? <br>
Blockchain is decentralized and hence there is no central place for it to be stored. That's why it is stored in computers or systems all across the network.<br>
These systems or computers are known as nodes. Each of the nodes has one copy of the blockchain or in other words, the transactions that are done on the network.</p>

<p>What is Hyperledger?</p>
<p>Hyperledger is an open source effort to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies for business use. It's a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation®.<br>
183+ diverse members and nine ongoing projects, including Hyperledger Indy, work in concert to create an open, standardized, and enterprise-grade distributed ledger framework and code base.</p>

<p>What is a DID?</p>
<p>A DID Entity is a data structure comprised of a collection of key-value pairs with keys such as: id (DID), service (endpoints), authentication, publicKey, @context, etc.<br>
A DID Document is a JSON-LD serialization of a DID Entity. A DID Document has a set of attributes such as the following: id (DID), service (endpoints), authentication, publicKey, @context, etc.<br>
The id (DID) attribute is the unique identifier or key for the DID Document.</p>
